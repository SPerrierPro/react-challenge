This project is the really first one I made using React and TS.

After being in my begginer bootcamp for a month, learning HTML, CSS and JS, we started using React and TS for the very first time this week.
As I wanted to go deeper and learn some more stuff, I tried to do my best for this side project.

The goal here was to be able, in a couple of days, to have a webpage using React; to go deeper with props, components and states. This is the main reason why footer is empty for example; I wanted to focus on functional elements.

I did my best to do things as clean as I know how to do for now, and to go deeper in React comprehension with things I thought were too hard for me too understand just two days ago, so I hope you'll enjoy my work!
